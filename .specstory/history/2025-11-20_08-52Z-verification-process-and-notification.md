Verification typically takes a few minutes. If there's a high volume of requests, it may take up to a few days.

Wait here or let us notify you of the outcome.

You will be contacted via email.

**Analyzing Localization Needs**

I've got a grasp of the task: translate UI text to Chinese, but leave the English comments untouched. I'm focusing on locating the translatable text within the codebase now. My next step will be to explore the best methods for managing the translation and ensuring that comments remain untouched.


**Searching for UI Text**

I'm currently focused on the initial step: pinpointing the target text within the codebase. My approach is to conduct a thorough search for the UI text string. Once located, I can begin to assess the surrounding code.

**Analyzing Missing Data**

I'm currently focused on the text that I can't quite pinpoint. The search for the missing pieces is underway. I've switched strategies, now focusing on segments and potential variable substitutions. I'm hoping to piece it together.

**Testing different prompts**

I'm still struggling to get the response I'm looking for. I tried a few more variations, like "Wait here or let us notify you," but still no luck. It seems I need to refine the prompt further to get the desired output.

**Assessing the Source Material**

I'm hitting a snag. The text isn't directly present in the code. My current hypotheses lean towards a future addition, an ignored file, or dynamically generated content. The user's prompt, however, still suggests a translation is required. It's a tricky situation.


**Verifying the Project Context**

I've exhausted the initial search and now I'm changing tack. I'm taking stock of the broader context. I'll examine the project directory structure next, specifically looking for localization files or any clues about dynamic content generation. Listing all files is a quick sanity check before I proceed with the translation, given the earlier prompt.

**Assessing the Project's Scope**

I'm leaning towards the project being either a Chrome extension or a web app, probably built with React and Vite. My thinking is that if the user wants a simple add/translate function, I'll provide the translation directly. I'm focusing on parsing the user query now.


**Refining Translation Strategy**

The user query calls for translation, so I'm providing it directly. The source text has been identified and I've selected Chinese as the target language. Considering the instructions, I've prepared a comprehensive translation, ready to present it as requested. I've also noted the user's rule for comments in English.


**Defining the Output Format**

I'm now focusing on formatting the translated output. Considering the user's specific instruction to provide comments in English, I'm planning to incorporate those, clearly distinguishing them from the Chinese translation. I've also re-evaluated the context of the user's query, deciding to prioritize delivering the direct translation, as that aligns with the explicit request for "translation" of the provided text.
