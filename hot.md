Introducing Claude Opus 4.5: the best model in the world for coding, agents, and computer use.

Opus 4.5 is a step forward in what AI systems can do, and a preview of larger changes to how work gets done.
--------------
So, basically when working on frontend only use Claude 4.5.

Backend, refactoring, logic issues, Codex-High. 

Hope this helps!
--------------
Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5.

The best coding model in the world combined with the best character of any model I've seen.
--------------
My workflow to spin up 3 coding agents at once:

- type “ai” in terminal
- launches Claude Code, Gemini CLI, & Codex CLI
- fully synced windows
- prompt w/ voice
- hit send & watch

Now Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI o3 work on task - you pick the winner.

Guide below.
--------------
sydney sweeney reveals in an interview that her current favourite model is gpt-5.

"claude code's been an enjoyable experience. i have loved sonnet/opus 4 for coding but lately anthropic is fucking up and sonnet 4 is pushing too much slop. gpt-5 in cursor/codex been a saviour"
--------------
Claude is now available in public preview in Microsoft Foundry.

@Azure customers can now use Claude Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5, and Opus 4.1 to build applications and enterprise agents, and to power Claude Code.

BREAKING: Claude Sonnet 4.5 just dropped and it's INSANE

It can literally work for 30 hours straight BY ITSELF

If you aren't taking advantage of everything new here you're falling behind

Here's everything you need to know about Sonnet 4.5 and how to get the most out of it:
--------------
BREAKING : Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 and it scores 80.9% on SWE bench verified! 

Where is the wall? 
--------------
Used Claude's new Code Interpreter for a real task for the first time this morning - uploading a 1,800 line CSV file (not one I'm willing to share) and asking for analysis of data over time and theories on why certain trends had happened - Opus 4.1 did an outstanding job with it
--------------
GLM 4.5 with Claude Code is the closest thing to Opus 4

> GLM 4.5 beats Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 in the Berkeley Function-Calling Benchmarks

> GLM Coding Plans for Claude Code are $3/$15 NOT $100/$200

> For Agents: GLM 4.5 > KIMI K2 > QWEN 3 235B NON-THINKING > Qwen 3 CODER 480B
--------------
Loads of releases are expected today 

And from Anthropic we may get: 
- Opus 4.5 
- Claude Code desktop 

And I am turning offline for the next 7 hours cuz my son is turning 5 today. 

Leaving @patience_cave to hold the gate from BREAKING, at least for some time lol.
--------------
Claude Code is now available in our desktop app. 

Run multiple sessions in parallel: code, research, and update work all at once.

And Plan Mode gets an upgrade with Opus 4.5—Claude asks clarifying questions upfront, then works autonomously.
--------------
I had early access to Opus 4.5 & it is a very impressive model that seem to be right at the frontier

Big gains in ability to do practical work (like make a PowerPoint from an Excel) and the best results ever (& in one shot) in my Lem poetry test, plus good results in Claude Code
--------------
Claude code quietly dropped a new "Explore" feature with the latest Haiku 4.5 release. 

Opus likes it a lot and uses it pretty heavily, so I dug in to see how it works
--------------
Claude Code / vibe coding hacks that are working extremely well for me right now

1) split terminal Opus 4.1 with gemini 2.5 pro - I find it valuable to play ai ping pong to diagnose issues, research, etc. Opus codes, gemini does other tasks

2) clerk auth is really easy to

--------------
Opus 4.5 spotted in Claude Code CLI Pull Request
--------------
I'm finding that gpt-5-codex > claude 4.5 sonnet (for coding, via codex cli / claude code)

Not sure how to quantify it, but qualitatively:
- gpt-5-codex writes much more rigorous/performant/robust code by default

- gpt-5-codex feels more creative, it solves difficult implicit
--------------
My review of Sonnet 4.5 based on ~30 hours of Claude Code use is that it’s basically the same as Opus 4.1. Which is quite good! But not as good as GPT-5 (codex thinking=high). 

Claude Code is still much more polished than Codex. But I find GPT-5 much stronger as a model.
--------------
Claude 4 is here: Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 are now live!

These are the best coding models in the world. Opus 4 can handle complex tasks for hours on end – one team ran it for 7 straight hours refactoring code.

No more painful either/or decisions for founders. Looking forward to

【Claude 4.5 Sonnet 登場】
1-2週間以内にリリースか？と噂されていた Claude Sonnet 4.5 が突如リリースされました

・ベンチマークではGPT-5やOpus 4.1を超える最強のコーディングモデル
・同時にVS Code拡張もモダンな感じになってCheckpoint機能も搭載
・Chrome拡張ほか様々な新機能も登場
--------------
Claude 4.1 Opus does even better. And went interactive (I couldn't get past level 2 so had to ask it to create a skip button so I could see all 9 "circles of CAPTCHA Hell") as it called them.
--------------
Putting all else aside when comparing Gemini CLI vs Claude Code - the simple fact is this

Claude Opus 4 is SIGNIFICANTLY better than Gemini 2.5 Pro

It's not even close right now.

Opus is the best agentic model & every time I use something else, I regret it*

(*except for o3)
--------------
Claude 4.5 Sonnet is dangerously good.

But 99% of people are sleeping on what it can actually do.

I’ve used it to build apps, generate content, automate deep research, and more.

Here are 10 ways to use Claude 4.5 Sonnet that feel like cheating:
--------------
Haiku 4.5 surpasses Sonnet 4 on computer use tasks, making Claude for Chrome even faster.

In Claude Code, it makes multi-agent projects and rapid prototyping markedly more responsive.
--------------
Anthropic asked 18 staff members to estimate the productivity boost they get from using Opus 4.5 + Claude Code:

- 50% (9/18) reported productivity improvement of at least 100%(!)

- Mean productivity improvement was 220%(!)

- 11% (2/18) characterized the model as a

--------------
Anthropic is working on a new Skill creation flow where Claude itself can create the Skill for you. 

Other things to expect this week:
- Opus 4.5 is rumoured to be launched today (not confirmed). 
- Claude code desktop app?
- New referral program 
- Megabrain?
--------------
So ChatGPT-5 has:

- 400k context window
- very good tool calling 
- beats Opus 4.1 on SWE-bench
- significantly cheaper API pricing

It will be interesting to see if they give Codex any love with a plan like Claude Code Max. 

My gut reaction: stick with Claude Code…
--------------
sonnet 4.5 dropped 2 weeks back – “the best coding model yet”

we ran it through our internal agentic coding benchmark – real-world engineering tasks and codebases. 

results: indeed, claude 4.5 wins! (although gpt-5-codex is close and costs less than half)

but something much
--------------
After a HUGE week of Google, xAI and OpenAI releases, @Anthropic has now entered the Arena with Claude Opus 4.5! 

Claude Opus 4.1 currently holds a strong #4 on the WebDev leaderboard (powered by Code Arena) and ranks #7 in the super competitive Text Arena. 

How much stronger
--------------
claude opus 4.5 is finally out! 

my favorite change thus far: claude FINALLY has perfect 20-20 vision and is no longer visually impaired!

throw huge screenshots and images and notice a huge improvement. much better at tool calls and the usual b2b SaaS (as well as b2b sass)! fun
--------------
Claude 4.5について
・ベンチマーク的には良い。プログラミング、金融などの業務領域、安全性などで最高性能で、Anthropicらしさと、4.5のナンバリングの妥当性が出ている
・一方で、特にコーディングのベンチマークについてはよくみるとCPT-5 Codexとは僅差でもある。Claude

Claude Sonnet 4.5 is live on OpenRouter!

Substantial gains on coding and math over Opus 4.1, but at normal Sonnet prices.

--------------
looks like claude code 2.0 also got rid of the opus to plan/sonnet to code option?
--------------
As I refactor a bunch of code, asking how things work, and how we can re-architect the boundaries of responsibility

it seems like:

- claude-4-opus has better "taste"
- while gpt-5-high is more accurate

My flow often ends up like this:

1. ask gpt-5-fast to outline how the

俺の体感だとこのベンチ全然直観に合わない。

Update on Claude/Claude Code performance issues by Anthropic

- found two bugs that degraded output
- bugs were on Sonnet 4 and Haiku 3.5
- they never intentionally degrade output

I pretty much exclusively use Opus so maybe this is why I’ve been crushing it with CC?
--------------
Anthropic just dropped Claude Opus 4.1 

It outperforms OpenAI o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen-3 Coder on agentic coding and tool use. 

Claude Code is going to get incredibly better.
--------------
Claude Opus 4.5 is now available wherever you get your Claude!

* 80.9% on SWE-bench verified - best coding model ever
* New Advanced Tool Use capabilities on Claude API
* Claude Code on the desktop

Btw usage limits have been reset for everyone. Happy coding!
--------------
After several more days of intense usage of GPT-5 via Cursor and via the GPT-5 Pro model in the web app, I stand by everything I said about it being a much smarter model and better at coding than Opus 4.1

I still like Opus and do find the ergonomics of Claude Code to be nicer in

--------------
rumours say Claude's next model (4.5) might launch soon

overall, Anthropic models are still great

but there has been a serious quality drop in Opus 4.1 and Claude Code over the last month

launching Claude 4.5 now wouldn't be smart, unless the recent degradation was intentional
--------------
Codex gets it done, fast and without extra steps

while Claude Code requires more planning to reach the same result

claude code CLI is still a bit better, but OpenAI has been updating Codex nearly every day

moreover, GPT-5 has been significantly better than Opus 4.1

Workflow now:

1) if I need up-to-date docs for anything I use o3 with web search in ChatGPT

2) generate plan with repo prompt + Gemini 2.5 pro

3) pass those to Claude Code with 4 Opus

4) it almost always nails it, sometimes I’ll edit it just a bit further in Cursor

So good.
--------------
Opus 4.1 is now available to paid Claude users and in Claude Code.

It’s also available on our API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI and you should be able to treat it as a drop-in replacement for Opus 4.

I've been testing Claude 4.5 Opus for coding the past few days, and here's my take:

- solid little independent operator

- still prone to the most annoying

About to go crazy with Opus 4.5 inside of Claude Code!

I was using Sonnet 4.5 as my default (and with great success), but I hear Opus 4.5 is much better at planning, orchestrating, and token-efficient.

As assumed, looks like Claude Code is rolling out also for Claude Pro users now - but you get approximately 10-40 prompts every 5 hours, won't be able to use Opus 4 with Claude Code, and it's best for light work on small repositories typically under 1,000 lines of code

Seeing a lot of people showing Claude Code say it’s Sonnet 3.5 when set to Opus 4.1

What do you think would be more likely:

1. The model is hallucinating its version as they are known to (not limited to Anthropic either)

2. Anthropic points Opus to a multiple versions out of

expectation: there's no way Opus 4.5 will be as smart as Gemini 3 or GPT 5.1, and it will fail all my hard debugging prompts and λ-calculus problems. Anthropic is way behind in terms of raw logical intelligence. but it might make Claude Code more interesting than Codex again

Been doing heavy development all week and this is what's currently working well for me:

- 2 x Claude Code (Opus 4.1) doing feature dev
- 1 x Cursor Agent (GPT-5) doing debug and fixes

GPT-5 doesn't get stuck in circles the way that Claude does, but it hasn't fully won me over
--------------
Wanted to be more specific in my response- the Claude Code team largely uses Sonnet 4.5 in Claude Code

See: https://x.com/_catwu/status/1973524717899489340…

Opus has a big model smell for sure, but Sonnet 4.5 is the daily driver for me in agentic coding

Some ways Opus 4.5 enhance Claude Code:

1. http://claude.ai/code (Web, iOS, and now Desktop (@amorriscode)) implements large changes much better than Sonnet 4.5. I now throw every problem at http://claude.ai/code for a first draft.
